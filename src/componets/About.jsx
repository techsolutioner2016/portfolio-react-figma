         As a Business Information Systems Graduate, Software Developer, and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, 
          I excel in guiding teams through technical challenges, cloud migration initiatives, workload architecture reviews, 
          and mitigating high-risk issues. My expertise bridges the gap between the technical and business aspects of projects. 
          With a focus on Full-Stack engineering, I actively engage in personal projects using various technologies such as MERN, 
          Vite, ReactJS, NodeJS, C#, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Tailwindcss, SaSS, MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, NoSQL, IAM, RBAC, AI, and various 
          AWS services. My GitHub repositories demonstrate my passion for continuous growth, endless learning, and professional development, 
          showcasing hands-on experiences and efficiently building secure, reliable projects with cloud technologies.
